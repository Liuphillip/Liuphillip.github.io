#### Description
In a group of three we built an arduino controlled moving bridge out of popsicle sticks. The coding for the bridge was done exclusively by me.
The bridge has the following features:

- Controlled traffic lights
- Object detection
- Traffic detection
- Ship traffic lights

The bridge is able to detect traffic under the bridge using utrasonic sensors and move up when there is an object under the bridge. When there is traffic **on** the bridge the bridge will not lift up. The bridge includes traffic lights for over the bridge traffic and under the bridge traffic which change colors depending on the type of trafic the bridge is currently servicing.

This is a remote control tank built with an arduino and tamiya tank track model set. 
The tank is connected wirelessly via bluetooth to a phone, and controlled using a custom app built in MIT app inventor.
The code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Liuphillip/Arduino-Tank)

Components Used:

-arduino uno
-tamiya tank track set
-l-298n motor controller
-3 x 16350 batteries

### Pong

Using C++ and the SFML graphics library I created the classic Pong game. The program uses object oriented programming.
