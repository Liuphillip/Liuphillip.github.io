#### Description
In a group of three we built an arduino controlled moving bridge out of popsicle sticks. The coding for the bridge was done exclusively by me.
The bridge has the following features:

- Controlled traffic lights
- Object detection
- Traffic detection
- Ship traffic lights

The bridge is able to detect traffic under the bridge using utrasonic sensors and move up when there is an object under the bridge. When there is traffic **on** the bridge the bridge will not lift up. The bridge includes traffic lights for over the bridge traffic and under the bridge traffic which change colors depending on the type of trafic the bridge is currently servicing.

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

This text is ***really important***.

- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 36:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>code blocks are indented with a tab</title>
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.
